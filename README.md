The player awakes in the middle of an underground maze, finding himself deep down the sewers of an old part of a big city, 
no trace of light can be seen besides some broken and flickering lights. Besides the player, there is somebody or something 
else lurking on the dark: besides other victims in the same situation the player is, trying to get out of the maze, theres a 
monster killing whomever he reaches. The other victims donâ€™t know or care about the other people locked inside the maze and 
will close the only exit right behind them.
